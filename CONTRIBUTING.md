# Contributing to soul-patch
Thanks for your interest in contributing to this repository! Honestly, this is a pretty bare bones typescript project right now so the learning curve is not to hard to get into.

## Getting Started
You can check [the issues page](https://github.com/geooot/soul-patch/issues) for things that need implementation. Every pull request should be tied to an issue. If you want to improve on something but don't see an issue for it, go ahead and make one as well as your PR.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and go through the linter). 

- Don't put submodule updates in your pull request unless they are to landed
  commits.
